# AI Interview Voice Assistant

An intelligent voice-enabled interview preparation assistant that helps you practice for technical and HR interviews. The assistant uses advanced AI to simulate real interview scenarios and provides instant feedback through voice interaction.

## üìù Project Summary

This project is an AI-powered interview preparation tool that combines voice interaction with advanced language models to create a realistic interview experience. The system is designed to help candidates practice both technical and HR interviews in a natural, conversational way.

### Key Findings
- Voice interaction significantly improves interview practice engagement
- AI responses need to be carefully tuned for interview scenarios
- Local processing of voice data enhances privacy and reduces latency
- Continuous speech recognition improves natural conversation flow

## üåü Key Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Speak naturally with the AI interviewer
- **Real-time Responses**: Get instant voice and text responses
- **Interview Practice**: Practice both technical and HR interview questions
- **Smart AI**: Powered by advanced language models for realistic interview simulation
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface with voice and text options
- **Secure**: Your API key is stored locally and never shared

## üéØ How It Works

### Core Technology Flow
1. **Voice Input** ‚Üí Your voice is converted to text using Web Speech API
2. **Text Processing** ‚Üí The text is sent to OpenAI's GPT model for intelligent responses
3. **AI Response** ‚Üí The model generates contextually relevant interview responses
4. **Voice Output** ‚Üí The AI's response is converted back to speech for natural interaction

### Key Components
- **Frontend**: Handles voice input/output and user interface
- **Backend**: Processes requests and manages AI interactions
- **AI Model**: Powers intelligent interview responses
- **Speech API**: Manages voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome recommended)
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
- Docker installed on your computer

### Detailed Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-interview-voice-assistant.git
cd ai-interview-voice-assistant
```

2. **Set Up Environment**
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Start the Application**
```bash
# Start the application using Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

4. **Access the Application**
- Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000
- Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted
- Click "Start Speaking" to begin your interview practice

## üí° How to Use

1. **Starting a Session**
   - Click the "Start Speaking" button
   - Allow microphone access when prompted
   - Begin speaking your interview questions

2. **During the Interview**
   - Speak naturally as you would in a real interview
   - The AI will respond both in voice and text
   - You can pause and resume speaking as needed

3. **Ending a Session**
   - Click "Stop Speaking" when you're done
   - Review the conversation history
   - Start a new session anytime

## üîí Security & Privacy

- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in your browser
- No data is stored on our servers
- All communication is encrypted
- Voice data is processed locally
